# JavaScript

- JS is a synchronous single-threaded language.
- Everything in JS happens inside an execution context. 
- In execution context, variables are UNDEFINED initially. And in case of functions(assigned to variable), it store the whole function.
- For executing the function, a new execution context created inside the execution context.
